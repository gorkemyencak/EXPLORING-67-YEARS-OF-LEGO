# EXPLORING-67-YEARS-OF-LEGO

The Rebrickable database includes data on every LEGO set that ever been sold; the names of the sets, what bricks they contain, what color the bricks are, etc. It might be small bricks, but this is big data! In this project, we will get to explore the Rebrickable database. 

Everyone loves Lego (unless you ever stepped on one). Did you know by the way that "Lego" was derived from the Danish phrase leg godt, which means "play well"? Unless you speak Danish, probably not.

In this project, we will analyze a fascinating dataset on every single lego block that has ever been built!
